Question 0: Why is this error being thrown?

We haven't defined a Pokemon model, but our home_controller calls Pokemon.where. So, it can't find Pokemon and throws an error.

Question 1: How are the random Pokemon appearing? What is the common factor between all the possible Pokemon that appear? 

The Pokemon are all defined in seeds.rb, they are what we populated the database with. Because our seed Pokemon don't have a trainer associated with it, they are part of the trainerless_pokemon defined in home_controller for the index. 

Question 2a: What does the following line in the help text do? Be specific about what "capture_path(id: @pokemon)" is doing. If you're having trouble, look at the Help section in the README. *
<%= button_to "Throw a Pokeball!", capture_path(id: @pokemon), :class => "button medium", :method => :patch %>

It creates a button that says "Throw a Pokeball!" that calls the capture function in pokemon_controller and puts the current pokemon
s id into the params. It's a patch request, so it is going to update a pokemon that has already been created

Question 2b: Change the URI pattern of the capture_path from "capture" to "asdf". Try capturing another Pokemon. Why does the route still work? 

The route still works because the button calls the capture function using the prefix "capture", so it doesn't depend on the URI to be anything specific.

Question 3: What would you name your own Pokemon? *

Question 4: What did you pass into the redirect_to? If it is a path, what did that path need? If it is not a path, why is it okay not to have a path here?



Question 5: Explain how putting this line "flash[:error] = @pokemon.errors.full_messages.to_sentence" shows error messages on your form. *
Hint: Take a look at views/layouts/application.html.erb. What does this file do, and what is it rendering? If you need to learn more about application.html.erb, Google is your friend!
